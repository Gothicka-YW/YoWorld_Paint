# � YoWorld Paint – Changelog

## v3.2.1 — Update
**Release Date:** 2025-11-08

Improvements
- Resilience: background redirect probes YoWorld Info proxy and falls back to direct image URL if the proxy is down
- Home: added “Save in YoWorld” button to upload directly to YoWorld so the image persists when clicking OK (requires the paintboard dialog open)
- Home: data URLs pasted in the input are auto‑uploaded and converted to https links (ImgBB)
- Sales Boards: picker works on any page (not limited to yoworld.info); improved messages when injection fails
- UI: transparency preview uses a standard grey checkerboard behind PNGs (Home preview and Sales tiles)
- Version bump: manifest version/name and UI title updated to 3.2.1

Other updates included in 3.2.1
- Themes: Added Pastel Breeze, Mint Frost, Aurora Rose, and a high‑contrast Teal Contrast theme; removed Solar Gold (low contrast)
- Theme selector: Alphabetized dropdown; Crimson remains the default
- Accessibility: Enable Redirect toggle ON state now uses the active theme accent gradient + glow + label accent for clearer status
- UI: Added Tools tab placeholder (Perspective Fix & Image Splitter design phase) and widened popup to 540px to fit six tabs
- Styling: Quick Image Uploader heading standardized to FAQ heading font; restored lost uploader/toast styles into CSS (removed inline styling)

Notes
- Perspective/Skew correction and Image Splitting are in design only (no shipped logic yet)
- Testing of offline yoworld.info fallback still pending manual simulation

## v2.2 Release - Tested
**Release Date:** 2025-09-03
- Added optional donation button under FAQ tab.
