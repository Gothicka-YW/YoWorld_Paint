**Release Date:** 2025-10-16

## Improvements

- Selector logic is generalized to capture all cards in the grid, fixing “No selector. Use pick.” errors.
- Debug logging removed for release.

## How to Update
- Reload the extension in Chrome after updating.
- Use the Pick Card Selector in the Sales Boards tab to select any card in the grid, regardless of extra text/captions.
- Preview and Export will now work reliably for all layouts.

## Other Notes
- No changes to privacy policy or data handling; extension remains local-only and does not collect personal data.
- See CHANGELOG.md and README.md for full details.
